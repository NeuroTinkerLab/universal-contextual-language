# Core Concepts of UCL

The Universal Contextual Language (UCL) is built upon several core concepts that work together to enable precise, unambiguous, and machine-processable communication. Understanding these concepts is key to effectively using and interpreting UCL.

## 1. The UCL Message Structure

As introduced in "Getting Started," a UCL message has a well-defined overall structure:

`[Source] [Direction] Target OperationVerb OperationID_UCLID [: Payload] # ContextStack`

Let's revisit each major part:

*   **Source (Optional):** *Who* is sending the message or initiating the action. Identified by a `UCLID`.
*   **Direction (Optional):** *Which way* the primary communication flows (e.g., `>` for request, `<` for response). Defaults to `>` if omitted and not otherwise inferable.
*   **Target (Mandatory):** *To whom or what* the message is addressed or primarily concerns. Identified by a `UCLID`.
*   **Operation (Mandatory):** *What* action is being requested or what aporconcept is central. Composed of an `OperationVerb` (like `query`, `execute`) and a more specific `UCLID_OperationSpecific` (like `schema:Book` or `ucl:action:generateReport`).
*   **Payload (Optional):** *The data* or parameters for the operation, or the data being returned. Structured as a `Value` (which can be a literal, a UCL-ID, a List, or a Map). Preceded by a colon (`:`) if present.
*   **Context Stack (Mandatory):** *The interpretive frame* for the entire message. A stack of `UCLID`s specifying contexts, from most specific to most general, separated by `/`. Preceded by a hash (`#`).

## 2. UCL-IDs: Unique and Semantic Identifiers

UCL-IDs are the cornerstone of UCL's ability to achieve semantic clarity.

*   **What they are:** Globally unique identifiers for *anything* â€“ concepts, entities (like a specific book or city), properties (like "author" or "population"), actions (like "find" or "create"), contexts (like "FinancialTrading" or "LiteraryAnalysis"), etc.
*   **Canonical Form (URI):** The standard representation of a UCL-ID is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), like a web address (e.g., `http://schema.org/Book`). This allows anyone, anywhere, to refer to the same concept unambiguously.
*   **Compact Form (CURIE-like):** For readability and brevity in UCL messages, URIs are often shortened using prefixes (e.g., `schema:Book`).
    *   **`@prefix` Declarations:** These are used at the beginning of a UCL message to define what a prefix (like `schema:`) stands for (e.g., `@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/>`).
    *   **Predefined Prefixes:** UCL also has some built-in, well-known prefixes (like `ucl:`, `rdf:`, `xsd:`) that don't need to be declared in every message.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Unambiguity:** `wd:Q42` always refers to Douglas Adams on Wikidata, no matter who uses it.
    *   **Interoperability:** Systems can "agree" on the meaning of terms by agreeing on the UCL-IDs (URIs) that represent them.
    *   **Machine Processability:** URIs are easily processed by software.

## 3. The Payload: Structuring Data

The `PayloadPart` is where the specific data for an operation resides. UCL supports:

*   **Literals:**
    *   **Strings:** Textual data, e.g., `"Hello, UCL!"`.
    *   **Numbers:** Integers and decimals, e.g., `123`, `3.14159`.
    *   **Booleans:** `true` or `false`.
    *   **Null:** The special value `ucl:val:null` to represent absence or non-applicability.
    *   **DateTime:** ISO 8601 formatted date-times, e.g., `"2024-03-15T10:00:00Z"`.
    *   **Duration:** ISO 8601 formatted durations, e.g., `"PT2H"`.
    *   **Binary:** Base64 encoded binary data, e.g., `ucl:datatype:binary("SGVsbG8=")`.
*   **UCL-ID References:** A UCL-ID can itself be a value in the payload, referring to another defined entity or concept.
*   **Lists (`ListValue`):** Ordered sequences of values, enclosed in square brackets `[...]`, with elements separated by commas. Lists can be nested and contain mixed types.
    *   Example: `[ "apple", 1, { ucl:param:color: "red" } ]`
*   **Maps (`MapValue`):** Unordered collections of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces `{...}`, with pairs separated by commas and keys separated from values by a colon.
    *   **Keys:** Can be UCL-IDs (preferred for semantics) or String Literals.
    *   **Values:** Can be any UCL `Value` type, allowing for nested maps and lists.
    *   Example: `{ schema:name: "UCL Guide", ucl:param:version: 4.2, ucl:param:authors: ["AI Assistant", "User"] }`

The ability to nest lists and maps allows for the representation of arbitrarily complex data structures.

## 4. The Context Stack: Framing Interpretation

The `ContextStackPart` is a unique and powerful feature of UCL.

*   **What it is:** An ordered list (a "stack") of one or more UCL-IDs, each representing a "context." Contexts are separated by `/`.
    *   Example: `# ucl:context:FinancialTransaction / schema:Invoice / ucl:standard:UBL@2.1`
*   **Purpose:** It provides the necessary background or frame of reference for interpreting the entire UCL message, especially the `OperationPart` and `PayloadPart`.
*   **How it works:**
    *   **Specificity:** Contexts are typically ordered from most specific (left) to most general (right). The most specific context has the greatest influence.
    *   **Disambiguation:** The same UCL-ID in a payload (e.g., `ucl:param:amount`) might mean different things in different contexts (e.g., a monetary amount in a `#ucl:context:Financial` vs. a quantity in a `#ucl:context:InventoryManagement`).
    *   **Guiding Behavior:** The receiving system can use the context stack to select appropriate processing rules, validation schemas, or behavioral responses.
*   **Mandatory:** Every UCL message must have at least one context. A generic context like `ucl:context:Generic` can be used if no other is more appropriate.

## 5. Operations: Defining Intent

The `OperationPart` (`OperationVerb UCLID_OperationSpecific`) clearly states the primary intent of the message.

*   **`OperationVerb`:** A standardized textual verb (like `query`, `execute`, `create`) that indicates the general nature of the action.
*   **`UCLID_OperationSpecific`:** A UCL-ID that further specifies the action or the main type of resource being acted upon (e.g., `schema:Book` for a query about books, or `ucl:action:sendEmail` for an execution command).

This clear definition of intent, combined with a structured payload and an explicit context, is what allows UCL to facilitate precise machine-to-machine and human-to-AI communication.
