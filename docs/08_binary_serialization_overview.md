## Purpose of UCL-Bin

The primary goals for defining a binary serialization format for UCL are:

1  **Compactness:** UCL-Bin will employ various techniques to minimize message size, such as:
    *   **Integer Packing:** Using variable-length integer encodings (VarInts) for lengths, counts, and numeric type tags.
    * byte markers (tags) to denote types, lists, maps, and other structural elements.

3.  **Parsing.  **Compactness:** To significantly reduce the message size compared to the textual representation, saving bandwidth and storage space.
2.   **String/UCL-ID Interning:** Storing frequently occurring strings and UCL-IDs (or their components) once in a table and referencing them via compact integer indices.
    *   **Native Binary Types:** Representing numbers and Serialization Speed:**
    *   The format should be designed to allow for fast encoding (serialization) of UCL data structures into bytes and fast decoding (parsing) of bytes back into UCL data structures or an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This  **Parsing Efficiency:** To allow for much faster parsing and serialization by machines, as binary formats can be processed more directly, booleans, and raw binary data in their native binary forms where efficient.
3.  **Parsing Efficiency:** The typically means avoiding complex lookaheads or backtracking during parsing.

4.  **Extensibility:**
    *   The without complex string manipulation and lexical analysis.
3.  **Reduced Ambiguity in Transmission:** Binary formats can be less format will be designed for fast and straightforward parsing by machines, minimizing complex string operations or lookaheads.
4.  **Ext binary format should include mechanisms (e.g., version flags, reserved type tags) to allow for future extensions to the UCL language prone to issues related to character encodings or whitespace variations that might affect textual formats if not handled strictly.
4.ensibility:** The binary format should include mechanisms (e.g., version flags, reserved type tags) to allow for future evolution without breaking backward compatibility with older parsers for common features.

5.  **Platform Independence:**
    *     **Direct Mapping:** To maintain a clear and lossless mapping to and from the UCL Canonical Textual Form. It mustUCL-Bin should define data representations (e.g., endianness for multi-byte numbers) to ensure that of the UCL language without breaking backward compatibility where possible.

 defined to be platform-independent (e.g., specifying endianness for multi-byte numeric types if necessary).

## Design

The design of UCL-Bin would be guided by the following principles:

*   **Self-Description (As outlined in Part 7 of the [UCL Specification](../SPECIFICATION.MD#part-7-canonical-binary-serialization Conceptual Structure of a UCL-Bin Message

A UCL-Bin message would likely consist of several key sections, conceptually similar to the outlinePartial):** Messages should ideally carry enough information (e.g., via type tags) for a parser to decode them without always-high-level-overview---ucl-bin), a UCL-Bin message would likely include:

*    in Part 7 of the [UCL Specification](../SPECIFICATION.MD):

1.  **Magic Number:** needing an external schema, though schema-informed parsing can offer further optimizations.
*   **Type Tagging:** Each**Magic Number:** A few bytes at the beginning to identify the stream as a UCL-Bin message.
*   ** A few fixed bytes at the beginning to identify the stream as a UCL-Bin message (e.g., `"UCLB"` data element (UCL-ID, string, number, list, map, etc.) would be preceded by one or more bytesHeader Flags:** Information about the UCL-Bin version, compression used (if any), endianness, etc.

2.  **Header / Flags:** Bytes 얼굴indicating:
    *   The version of the UCL-Bin format дорогаthat identify its type and potentially its length or encoding details.
*   **Variable-Length Encoding:** For integers and lengths[Optional] Prefix Table:** A binary representation of `@prefix` declarations if string interning for prefixes is used.
*    itself.
    *   Flags for features like payload compression (e.g., Gzip, Zstd).

3.  **[Optional] Prefix Table preferred to save space for smaller numbers.
*   **String/UCL-ID Interning:** To avoid repeating allowing them to be referenced by compact integer Gids in the body.
*   **Message Body:** A sequence of type:** If the message uses locally declared `@prefix` mappings, this section would efficiently encode those mappings (prefix string to base long strings (like URIs or common local parts of UCL-IDs), UCL-Bin should support a mechanism for string-tagged binary data representing each component of the UCL message (Source, Target, Operation, Payload, Contexts), with URI string).
4.  **[Optional] String/UCL-ID Interning Table:** A table of interning. This typically involves:
    *   A "string table" or "UCL-ID table" at the beginning lists and maps encoded efficiently.

## Relationship to Other Binary Formats

UCL-Bin would draw inspiration from established unique strings (UCL-ID local parts, literal strings, keys, etc.) used within the message. Subsequent occurrences of these strings of a message (or session) where each unique string is stored once.
    *   References to these strings within efficient binary serialization formats such as:
